# Michelle Brinich's Online Portfolio
## Project Motivation
As part of UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp, we were asked to make an online portfolio from scratch in HTML and CSS, given some guidance on appearance and functionality. As part of this project, I developed my online portfolio from scratch and inluded links to marketing projects I was proud to play a role in. The list of work is exemplative, not exhaustive.
